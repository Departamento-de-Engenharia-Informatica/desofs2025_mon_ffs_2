# STRIDE Threat Model – AMAPP User Registration DFD

| **Threat**                         | **Targeted Element**            | **STRIDE Category**    | **Description**                                                                                                                         | **Mitigation**                                                                                                                       |

| **Spoofing – Fake Registration**  | Registration API, Admin Portal   | Spoofing               | Attackers attempt to impersonate legitimate users or admins during registration.                                                       | Strong admin authentication; Validate client sessions; Use certificate pinning for internal interfaces.                            |
| **Tampering – Data Manipulation** | Registration Dataflows, DB       | Tampering              | Submitted registration data or approval status is modified before reaching the destination.                                            | Input validation; End-to-end encryption via HTTPS/TLS; Critical path validation on server side.                                      |
| **Repudiation – Denial of Action**| AMAPP API, Admin UI, User DB     | Repudiation            | Users or admins deny registration/approval actions if no audit trail is in place.                                                      | Secure audit logging; Timestamps and user ID tagging in log entries; Logs stored securely with append-only settings.                |
| **Information Disclosure**        | Registration Forms, DB Records   | Information Disclosure | Sensitive data (e.g., emails, phone numbers) leaked due to weak encryption or unsecured channels.                                     | Encrypt data in transit and at rest; Strict RBAC on user records; Use TLS across all communication layers.                          |
| **Denial of Service – Fake Entries** | Registration Endpoint, API DB   | Denial of Service      | Flood of fake registration requests overwhelms the backend, preventing valid user onboarding.                                          | CAPTCHA implementation; API throttling and rate limits; IP filtering; Detection of anomalous behavior at the gateway.               |
| **Elevation of Privilege**        | Approval Workflow, User Roles    | Elevation of Privilege | User manipulates approval flow or backend parameters to escalate to privileged roles like admin.                                       | Enforce server-side validation of roles; Block manual override from client; Multi-step approval processes with role separation.     |
