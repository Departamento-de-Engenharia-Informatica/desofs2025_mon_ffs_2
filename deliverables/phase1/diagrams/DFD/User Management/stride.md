# STRIDE Threat Model – AMAPP User/Roles Management DFD

| **Threat**                         | **Targeted Element**              | **STRIDE Category**    | **Description**                                                                                                                              | **Mitigation**                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Spoofing – Admin Impersonation**| User Management API               | Spoofing               | An attacker impersonates an administrator to perform unauthorized role or user management actions.                                          | Enforce multi-factor authentication for admins; Validate session tokens and origins; Mutual TLS authentication between services.         |
| **Tampering – Role Modification** | Role Assignment Requests, DB      | Tampering              | Malicious modification of role assignments or user attributes via intercepted or forged requests.                                           | Validate and sanitize all input; Use signed requests or JWTs; Apply strict server-side role validation.                                   |
| **Repudiation – Denial of Actions**| Management Interface, Logs        | Repudiation            | Admin denies having made changes to user accounts or roles if no tamper-proof audit trail exists.                                           | Implement immutable audit logs with timestamps and identifiers; Use append-only log storage.                                              |
| **Information Disclosure**        | Role Data, User Profiles, APIs    | Information Disclosure | Unauthorized access to user-role mappings or user data due to exposed APIs or insufficient response filtering.                             | Enforce TLS across all services; Limit response data to minimum necessary; Apply least privilege and RBAC controls.                       |
| **Denial of Service – API Flood** | User Management API               | Denial of Service      | Flood of fake user or role change requests exhausts server capacity, preventing legitimate administrative operations.                      | Rate limiting; CAPTCHA on sensitive endpoints; WAF/API Gateway throttling; Logging and alerting for abnormal patterns.                   |
| **Elevation of Privilege**        | Role Assignment Flow              | Elevation of Privilege | A regular user manipulates requests or claims to grant themselves unauthorized roles, such as admin access.                                | Strict server-side role enforcement; Secure claims validation; Never trust client input; Segregate duties across APIs and workflows.     |
