| INP02 – Overflow Buffers                   | Request Own Report | Tampering                | Buffer overflows in the request handler could allow an attacker to crash or take over the report-generation endpoint.                                                                               | Use languages/compilers with automatic bounds checking; prefer safe APIs; run static analysis to catch overflow risks.                 |
| AA01 – Authentication Abuse/ByPass         | View Own Report | Spoofing                 | An attacker who bypasses or steals credentials could view another producer’s report, compromising confidentiality.                                                                                  | Enforce strong authentication (e.g. OAuth 2.0), session timeouts, and multi-factor authentication.                                    |
| INP07 – Buffer Manipulation                | Request Report for Specific CoProducer | Tampering                | Maliciously crafted request parameters could manipulate internal buffers, leading to malformed queries or code execution in the report engine.                                                    | Validate and bound-check all inputs; use compiler-based canaries (StackGuard/ProPolice); adopt secure coding guidelines.             |
| AA02 – Principal Spoof                     | View Selected CoProducer Report | Spoofing                 | An attacker may spoof another user’s identity or stolen token to retrieve reports they’re not authorized to see.                                                                                    | Enforce strict authorization checks per request; implement token binding and rotate credentials regularly.                             |
| CR06 – Communication Channel Manipulation  | Generate Report | Information Disclosure   | A man-in-the-middle on the API↔engine channel could intercept the raw report stream and extract sensitive data.                                                                                     | Encrypt all in-transit data (TLS with strong ciphers); mutually authenticate endpoints; pin certificates.                              |
| DE03 – Sniffing Attacks                    | Query Database | Information Disclosure   | If the database link isn’t encrypted, an attacker sniffing the network can capture query results containing privileged report data.                                                                  | Use encrypted database connections (e.g. TLS); isolate the database network; enforce least-privilege network policies.                |
| AC21 – Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)   | Request Report | Spoofing                 | A forged request (e.g. via hidden form or link) could trick a logged-in user into submitting a report action they didn’t intend, exposing or altering data.                                         | Implement anti-CSRF tokens for each form/action; validate Referer/Origin headers; require re-authentication for sensitive operations. |
| INP41 – Argument Injection                 | Request Report | Tampering                | Injection of unexpected arguments into the report-request parameters could cause unintended behavior, data leakage or code execution in the report engine.                                         | Whitelist and sanitize all parameter values; enforce strict length/type checks; use parameterized APIs rather than string concatenation. |
